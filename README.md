# hello-world
My  first repository

Hello world, my name is Joe, I'm 18, and I have a doge named Juneau.
On Github, to "commit" means to save changes made to the branch.
The master branch can duplicate itself to create more branches.
I can improve the master branch by fixing bugs and/or adding features on another branch, and then merging.
